REST API](https://github.com/skrusche63/spark-rest)\r\n\r\nThe REST API for **Predictiveworks.** provides a one-stop strategy to the different predictive engines via a common interface:\r\n\r\n### [Reactive Association Analysis Engine](https://github.com/skrusche63/spark-arules)\r\n\r\n![Association Analysis Engine Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-insight/master/images/association-rules-overview.png)\r\n\r\nThe Association Analysis Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and is built to support association rule mining with a new and redefined \r\nmining algorithm. The approach overcomes the well-known \"threshold problem\" and makes it a lot easier to directly leverage the resulting content and product rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### [Reactive Context-Aware Analysis Engine](https://github.com/skrusche63/spark-fm)\r\n\r\n![Factorization Machines Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-insight/master/images/factorization-machines-overview.png)\r\n\r\nThe Context-Aware Analysis Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and has a strong focus on context-sensitive data and interactions in \r\nmulti-dimensional datasets. It is the key to the next-generation of personalized predictions and customer relationships.\r\n  \r\n\r\n### [Reactive Decision Analysis Engine](https://github.com/skrusche63/spark-decision)\r\n\r\n![Decision Analysis Engine Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-insight/master/images/decision-analysis-overview.png)\r\n\r\nThe Decision Analysis Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and is built to predict the best decisions among multiple courses of action \r\nand identify their decisive factors. The machine learning algorithm is unexcelled in accuracy among current algorithms and is based on ensemble learning \r\nand powerful randomization strategies. \r\n\r\n\r\n### [Reactive Intent Recognition Engine](https://github.com/skrusche63/spark-intent)\r\n\r\n![Intent Recognition Engine Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-insight/master/images/intent-recognition-overview.png)\r\n\r\nThe Intent Recognition Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and is built to uncover the intents of human behavior and reach\r\nthe ultimate customer understanding. It is based on an approved scientific algorithms to unveil and leverage hidden data from human behavior. \r\n\r\n\r\n### [Reactive Outlier Detection Engine](https://github.com/skrusche63/spark-outlier)\r\n\r\n![Outlier Detection Engine Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-insight/master/images/outlier-detection-overview.png)\r\n\r\nThe Outlier Detection Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and is built to find anomalies in large-scale datasets and human behavior \r\nfor advanced risk reduction. \r\n\r\n\r\n### [Reactive Series Analysis Engine](https://github.com/skrusche63/spark-fsm)\r\n\r\n![Series Analysis Engine Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-insight/master/images/series-analysis-overview.png)\r\n\r\nThe Series Analysis Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and is built to support sequential pattern mining with a new and redefined \r\nmining algorithm. The approach overcomes the well-known \"threshold problem\" and makes it a lot easier to directly leverage the resulting patterns and rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### [Reactive Similarity Analysis Engine](https://github.com/skrusche63/spark-cluster)\r\n\r\n![Similarity Analysis Engine Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-insight/master/images/similarity-analysis-overview.png)\r\n\r\nThe Similarity Analysis Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and is built to find relevant similarities in dynamic activity sequences and \r\nidentify customers by their journeys. It is based on the new S2MP algorithm to find similarities for sequential patterns in large scale datasets. \r\n\r\n\r\n### [Reactive Text Analysis Engine](https://github.com/skrusche63/spark-text)\r\n\r\n![Text Analysis Engine Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-insight/master/images/text-analysis-overview.png)\r\n\r\nThe Text Analysis Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and is built to support language-agnostic semantic concept detection and prediction \r\nfor semantic targeting.\r\n\r\n## [Predictiveworks. Elasticsearch Plug-in](https://github.com/skrusche63/elastic-insight)\r\n\r\nThe Elasticsearch plug-in for **Predictiveworks.** provides a seamless integration of today's most relevant predictive analytics for online publishers and retailers \r\nwith Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n![Elasticinsight.
