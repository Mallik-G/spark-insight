## Real-time Insights with Apache Spark

### Customer Loyalty 

The customer's engagement with a business is reflected by a wide range of events, such as e-commerce orders (or transactions), service calls, social media comments and more. All these events are indicative of the customer's loyalty to a certain business.

**Loyalty** is usually defined as the strength of the relationship between a customer and a certain business. A higher degree of loyality results in more purchase transactions and at a higher frequency.

### Association Rule (AR) Mining

Scala and Apache Spark based implementation of most recent Top-K Association Rule Algorithms as proposed by [Philippe-Fournier Viger](http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/). Top-K Association Rule Mining overcomes one of the major problems in traditional Association Rule approaches, i.e. tuning the *minimum support* parameter.

Top-K Association Rule Mining therefore is an appropriate candidate for applying this technique to real-time data streams. Read [more](http://skrusche63.github.io/spark-arules).
